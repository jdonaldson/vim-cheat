# Vim-cheat

This plugin lets you quickly open up a cheat sheet for a given language in a
vertical split.  I didn't write the cheat sheets, I cheated as well and used 
the ones from
[learnXinYminutes](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs).

The plugin adds a single command:  ```:ToggleCheat```.  This will open or close
a vertical split containing the read-only markdown cheat file for the current 
file type.

If a cheat file is not available, a message will be displayed.
